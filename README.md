# Machine-Learning-Model-For-Skin-Cancer-Detection
Skin cancer is the most common human malignancy, is primarily diagnosed visually, beginning with an initial clinical screening and followed potentially by dermoscopic analysis, a biopsy and histopathological examination. Automated classification of skin lesions using images is a challenging task owing to the fine-grained variability in the appearance of skin lesions.

# Dataset used
This the HAM10000 ("Human Against Machine with 10000 training images"
It consists of 10015 dermatoscopicimages which are released as a training set for academic machine learning purposes and are publiclyavailable through the ISIC archive.

It has 7 different classes of skin cancer which are listed below :
1. Melanocytic nevi
2. Melanoma
3. Benign keratosis-like lesions
4. Basal cell carcinoma
5. Actinic keratoses
6. Vascular lesions
7. Dermatofibroma
